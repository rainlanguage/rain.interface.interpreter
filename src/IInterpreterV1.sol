/// @title IInterpreterV1
/// Interface into a standard interpreter that supports:
///
/// - evaluating `view` logic deployed onchain by an `IExpressionDeployerV1`
/// - receiving arbitrary `uint256[][]` supporting context to be made available
///   to the evaluated logic
/// - handling subsequent state changes in bulk in response to evaluated logic
/// - namespacing state changes according to the caller's preferences to avoid
///   unwanted key collisions
/// - exposing its internal function pointers to support external precompilation
///   of logic for more gas efficient runtime evaluation by the interpreter
///
/// The interface is designed to be stable across many versions and
/// implementations of an interpreter, balancing minimalism with features
/// required for a general purpose onchain interpreted compute environment.
///
/// The security model of an interpreter is that it MUST be resilient to
/// malicious expressions even if they dispatch arbitrary internal function
/// pointers during an eval. The interpreter MAY return garbage or exhibit
/// undefined behaviour or error during an eval, _provided that no state changes
/// are persisted_ e.g. in storage, such that only the caller that specifies the
/// malicious expression can be negatively impacted by the result. In turn, the
/// caller must guard itself against arbitrarily corrupt/malicious reverts and
/// return values from any interpreter that it requests an expression from. And
/// so on and so forth up to the externally owned account (EOA) who signs the
/// transaction and agrees to a specific combination of contracts, expressions
/// and interpreters, who can presumably make an informed decision about which
/// ones to trust to get the job done.
///
/// The state changes for an interpreter are expected to be produces by an `eval`
/// and passed to the `IInterpreterStoreV1` returned by the eval, as-is by the
/// caller, after the caller has had an opportunity to apply their own
/// intermediate logic such as reentrancy defenses against malicious
/// interpreters. The interpreter is free to structure the state changes however
/// it wants but MUST guard against the calling contract corrupting the changes
/// between `eval` and `set`. For example a store could sandbox storage writes
/// per-caller so that a malicious caller can only damage their own state
/// changes, while honest callers respect, benefit from and are protected by the
/// interpreter store's state change handling.
///
/// The two step eval-state model allows eval to be read-only which provides
/// security guarantees for the caller such as no stateful reentrancy, either
/// from the interpreter or some contract interface used by some word, while
/// still allowing for storage writes. As the storage writes happen on the
/// interpreter rather than the caller (c.f. delegate call) the caller DOES NOT
/// need to trust the interpreter, which allows for permissionless selection of
/// interpreters by end users. Delegate call always implies an admin key on the
/// caller because the delegatee contract can write arbitrarily to the state of
/// the delegator, which severely limits the generality of contract composition.
